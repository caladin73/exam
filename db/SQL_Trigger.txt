SHOW TRIGGERS \G

The \G modifier in the MySQL command line client

A little publicized, but exceedingly useful feature
 of the MySQL command line client is the \G modifier.
 It formats the query output nicely, so you can read
 through it easier. To use it, you just replace the
 semi-colon at the end of the query with ‘\G’.


Triggers Order

 SELECT
     trigger_name, action_order
 FROM
     information_schema.triggers
 WHERE
     trigger_schema = 'classicmodels'
 ORDER BY event_object_table ,
          action_timing ,
          event_manipulation


/*The statement allows you to view both content of the trigger
and its metadata such as associated table name  and definer,
which is the name of MySQL user who created the trigger.*/
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.triggers
WHERE
  trigger_schema = 'c1db5'
    AND trigger_name = 'company_BEFORE_INSERT' \G
