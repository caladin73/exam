SHOW TRIGGERS \G

The \G modifier in the MySQL command line client

A little publicized, but exceedingly useful feature
 of the MySQL command line client is the \G modifier.
 It formats the query output nicely, so you can read
 through it easier. To use it, you just replace the
 semi-colon at the end of the query with ‘\G’.
