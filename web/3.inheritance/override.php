// The parent class has hello method that returns "beep".

    public function hello()
    {
        return "beep";
    }
}

//The child class has hello method that tries to override the hello method in the parent
class SportsCar extends Car {
    public function hello()
    {
        return "Hallo";
    }
}


//Create a new object
$sportsCar1 = new SportsCar();

//Get the result of the hello method
echo $sportsCar1 -> hello();

// we can advoid this by using Final in parent class!
